## Instructions for setup:

1. **If you have SSH setup on your machine, paste the following command:** 

    `git clone git@github.com:abhinav-lv/ADG-File-Upload-Task.git`

2. **Install dependencies using npm:**
    
    `npm i express express-session body-parser dotenv ejs fs-extra multer passport passport-google-oauth2`

3. >Since this app is currently not live, it needs the *GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID* and *GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET* in order to work, which are stored in a .env file and hence not tracked by git.

4. **Now run the command:**

    `node app.js`
